# ArduinoStarterKit
Repository of Arduino Starter Kit files and code.

In this repository I will store the code files and descriptions related to my Arduino starter kit projects. The starter kit provides an intro to digital electronics and embedded system programming through 15 projects. In some cases I will also provide alternative code for the projects where I have experimented with the functionality.
